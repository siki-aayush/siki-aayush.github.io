                    Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Aayush Musyaju. Currently, I am a computer
                    engineering undergrad. My passion and curiosity for
                    computers led me to pursue my bachelor's in computer
                    engineering. During my bachelors, I fell in love with
                    programming and learning new things every day. I enjoy
                    confronting challenges, devising solutions, and developing
                    products that will help people in their daily lives. My
                    interests do not stop there. I am also interested in deep
                    learning and cyber security. Basically, I am interested in
                    everything related to computers ðŸ¤£. Â 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Apart from the technical stuff, I love reading manga and
                    watching anime. I also enjoy making sketches of anime
                    characters.
